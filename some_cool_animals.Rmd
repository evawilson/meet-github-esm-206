##### A note on this project:

The organization of this document probably seems strange. That's because it's part of an entire multi-part lab for ESM 206, which students will create in multiple projects (but are combined here for easier sharing). Hence the weird unrelated pieces all put together in this project (students will create Parts 2 & 3 as separate projects).

### Cool animal fun facts {.tabset .tabset-fade} 

Tabset says that underneath this level three header (###), everything you have a level four header (####), it will create a new tab. You can see this when you knit the document. 

#### SHARKS!!!

##### Some great white shark facts (from [NatGeo Kids](https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/animals/sea-life/great-white-sharks/)):

- Great white sharks have ~ 300 teeth
- And swim way faster than you (25 mph)
- And are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List

#### California condors

##### Some California condor facts (from [Animal Fact Guide](https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/california-condor/)):

- By 1987, there were only 10 California condors living in the wild
- They are the largest flying bird in North America
- Critically endangered on the IUCN Red List (> 400 today)

#### American pika

##### Some American pika facts (from [OneKindPlanet.org](https://onekindplanet.org/animal/pika-american/)):

- Pika are of order *Lagomorpha* (which also includes rabbits)
- Pika live in high altitude talus slopes
- American pika are already disappearing from the Sierra Nevada

#### Ring-tailed cats
To make this work you need to have a space between the pound signs and the next lign of text (e.g. the ### below)

Here's where I want to have info on ringtails.

We'll also learn about 'knitr::include_graphics()'

Add a few fun facts:

- Ringcats can rotate their feet 180 degrees when climbing 

- Ringcats are not endangered, but they are very ellusive

- Ringcats are closely related to racoons


Whatever is in square = caption
() = path to image that you want to use 

###
Note: This ### now removes the tabset property you had established before. This is like a "gate." Everything below this will be out of the tabs.
